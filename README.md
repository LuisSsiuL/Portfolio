# Linear Regression 


This project demonstrates a fundamental machine learning algorithm: simple linear regression. Implemented from scratch using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries, it focuses on modeling the linear relationship between two variables.

The core of the project involves applying the least squares method to find the optimal slope and y-intercept for a line that best fits a given dataset. NumPy is used for efficient numerical computations, particularly for constructing the design matrix and solving the least squares equation using the pseudo-inverse (np.linalg.pinv). Matplotlib is then utilized to visualize the data points and the calculated regression line, providing a clear understanding of the model's fit.

This project serves as a foundational exercise in predictive modeling, illustrating the mathematical principles behind linear regression and the practical application of essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

Model Training & Visualization: A K-Means model was trained with the chosen number of clusters. The clustered data was then visualized using scatter plots of 'Annual Income (k$)' vs. 'Spending Score (1-100)' and 'Age' vs. 'Spending Score (1-100)', with clusters clearly distinguished by color and centroids marked.

Silhouette Score: The silhouette score for the K-Means model was calculated to evaluate the quality of the clusters, indicating how well-separated and cohesive the clusters are.

DBSCAN Clustering:

Parameter Optimization: A systematic approach was taken to find optimal eps (maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other) and min_samples (number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point) parameters. Heatmaps were generated to visualize the number of clusters and silhouette scores for various parameter combinations, aiding in the selection of the best-performing parameters.

Outlier Detection: DBSCAN's ability to identify outliers (noise points, labeled as -1) was utilized and visualized separately on the scatter plots.

Hierarchical Clustering:

Dendrogram Analysis: A dendrogram was generated to visually represent the hierarchical relationships between data points, helping to determine the optimal number of clusters by observing the longest vertical line that does not intersect any horizontal line.

Model Training & Visualization: An AgglomerativeClustering model was applied with the chosen number of clusters. Similar to K-Means, the clusters were visualized on scatter plots, showcasing the segmentation based on hierarchical grouping.

This project provides a comparative analysis of three prominent clustering techniques, demonstrating their application in customer segmentation and highlighting different approaches to cluster discovery and evaluation.
